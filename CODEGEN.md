The main crate gets generated by the script `codegen_n_build.sh`.
Most changes should be done in the template files there instead of
in the main crate.

This is my first ever codegen-like experience with Rust. The code is far
from optimal but good enough.

## Build Prerequisites
Because the examples uses "minifb" as dependency, on Linux the package `libxkbcommon-dev` is required
to run them. This is not necessary, if you just use this crate as dependency.
