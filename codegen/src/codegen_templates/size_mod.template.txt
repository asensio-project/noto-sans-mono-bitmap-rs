//! Module for letters with the font weight %FONT_WEIGHT% and size %FONT_SIZE%.

//! The bitmap font contains all unicode symbols from 0x00 to 0x17f with
//! the exception of control characters. It includes Basic Latin
//! Latin-1 Supplement and Latin extended A. This means the typical letters
//! and symbols from a QWERTZ/QWERTY keyboard plus symbols such as Ö, Ä,
//! and Ü.

/// The height of each bitmap character for the given font weight
/// and size. This size corresponds to the size of the module name.
/// The font size will be a few percent smaller, because each
/// bitmap contains a small vertical padding.

/// and size. This is a few percent less than [`BITMAP_HEIGHT`],
/// because the bitmap font doesn't contain horizontal padding.
