//! Pre-rasterized bitmap font from "Noto Sans Mono", an open font from Google. \

//!
//! # TL;DR
//! * ✅ `no_std`, zero allocations, no floating point operations
//! * ✅ most important symbols, numbers, and letters as pre-rasterized bitmap
//! * ✅ Noto Sans Mono font as base
//! * ✅ different sizes and font weights (light, normal, bold)
//! * ✅ nice anti-aliasing/smoothing and better looking than legacy bitmap fonts
//! * ✅ relevant font sizes, such as 14, 16, 24, 32, and 64px (as build time feature)

//! # When To Use This Crate
//! If you develop a kernel, you usually don't want to use the FPU (i.e. only soft float),
//! because otherwise you need to save the floating point registers on every context switch,
//! which is expensive. Because nice font rendering of TTF fonts heavily relies on many
//! floating point operations, this is not optimal inside a kernel (noticeable performance penalties).
//! Furthermore, in my experience it was hard to get some of the popular font rasterization
//! crates to compile with CPU features "+soft-float" and "-sse" (at least on x86_64).
//!
//! Legacy 8x8 bitmap fonts are ugly when printed to the screen. My crate can be seen as a nice
//! replacement with very nice anti-aliasing.
//!
//! If you have a standard environment or support for floating point operations, you might want
//! to rasterize the font by yourself with the crate `fontdue` and some TTF fonts rather than
//! using my crate.
//!
//! # Minimal Code Example
//! ```rust
//! use noto_sans_mono_bitmap::{get_bitmap, get_bitmap_width, BitmapHeight, FontWeight};
//!
//! // Minimal example.
//!
//! let width = get_bitmap_width(FontWeight::Regular, BitmapHeight::Size16);
//! println!(
//!     "Each char of the mono-spaced font will be {}px in width if the font \
//!      weight={:?} and the bitmap height={}",
//!     width,
//!     FontWeight::Regular,
//!     BitmapHeight::Size16.val()
//! );
//! let bitmap_char = get_bitmap('A', FontWeight::Regular, BitmapHeight::Size16);
//! println!("{:?}", bitmap_char);
//! for (row_i, row) in bitmap_char.bitmap().iter().enumerate() {
//!     for (col_i, pixel) in row.iter().enumerate() {
//!         println!("[{:02}][{:02}]: {:03}", row_i, col_i, pixel);
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Cargo build time features
//! If all Cargo features are available, this bitmap fonts supports `light`, `regular`,
//! and `bold`, but no `italic` style, because Noto Sans Mono doesn't have an italic
//! TTF file. The rasterization was done with the awesome [fontdue-Crate](https://crates.io/crates/fontdue).
//!
//! By default, all sizes and font styles/weights are included via the cargo feature `all`.
//! This can be restricted by only using features such as `regular` and `size_14`. Anyhow,
//! a test of mine showed, that including all features in a release build only increases the
//! file size by a few dozen kilobytes.
//!
//! The bitmap font includes the following unicode range:
//! - BASIC LATIN,
//! - LATIN 1 Supplement
//! - LATIN EXTENDED-A
//!
//! This means unicode symbols from `0 .. 0x17f`, hence letters
//! and symbols from a QWERTZ/QWERTY keyboard plus symbols such as
//! Ö, Ä, and Ü. Control characters are not included.
