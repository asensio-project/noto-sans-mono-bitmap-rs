//!
//! # TL;DR
//! * ✅ most important symbols, numbers, and letters as pre-rasterized bitmap
//! * ✅ Noto Sans Mono font as base
//! * ✅ different sizes and font weights (light, normal, bold)
//! * ✅ nice anti-aliasing/smoothing and better looking than legacy bitmap fonts
//!
//! If all Cargo features are available, this bitmap fonts supports `light`, `regular`,
//! and `bold`, but no `italic` style, because Noto Sans Mono doesn't have a italic
//! TTF file. The rasterization was done with the awesome [fontdue-Crate](https://crates.io/crates/fontdue).
//!
//! It is highly recommended to only include the font style and font size that you need,
//! otherwise this will bloat your executable by a few megabytes.
//!
//! The bitmap font includes the following unicode range:
//! - BASIC LATIN,
//! - LATIN 1 Supplement
//! - LATIN EXTENDED-A
//!
//! This means unicode symbols from `0 .. 0x17f`, hence letters and
//! and symbols from a QWERTZ/QWERTY keyboard plus symbols such as
//! Ö, Ä, and Ü. Control characters are not included.
